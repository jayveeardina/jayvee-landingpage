                        I am a <span class="highlight">responsible and optimistic</span> aspiring front-end web developer. 
                        Even though my previous work experience is mostly in the BPO 
                        industry, my dream of being a web developer has never changed. 
                        I've learned a lot in this experience that I believe I can use for this job. 
                        For example, I gained <span class="highlight">excellent communication skills.</span> I was able to<span class="highlight"> use 
                        different websites and applications </span>to assist customers and understand
                        the importance of having a clear and better web experience. I am 
                        looking forward to using these<span class="highlight"> skills and experience</span> at your company.
